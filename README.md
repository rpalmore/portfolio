# [portfolio](http://www.rebeccapalmore.com/).
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I also followed Dave Ceddia's excellent example for how to put my [Express API behind a proxy](https://daveceddia.com/create-react-app-express-production/) so I could use Nodemailer for emailing.

## Also built with

* Textillate.js
* React
* React Router
* Express
* Axios
* GreenSock
